### Mklaren

A Multiple kernel learning Python library.


#### Features
* Support for standard kernel functions (RBF, linear, polynomial, sigmoid)
* Efficient interface to the kernel matrix
* Low-rank kernel approximation methods (Incomplete Cholesky Decomposition, Cholesky with Side-information, the Nystrom method)
* Multiple kernel learning methods based on centered alignment
* Simultaneous multiple kernel learning and low-rank approximation base on least-angle regression (the Mklaren algorithm)
